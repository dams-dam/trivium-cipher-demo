## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive implementation and interactive demonstration of the Trivium stream cipher. Trivium, designed by Christophe De Canni√®re and Bart Preneel, is a synchronous stream cipher that generates up to 2^64 bits of keystream from an 80-bit secret key and an 80-bit initialization vector (IV). It was a finalist in the eSTREAM project, which aimed to identify new stream ciphers suitable for widespread adoption.

The Trivium cipher is notable for its simplicity, efficiency, and suitability for hardware implementation, making it an excellent subject for academic study and practical application in resource-constrained environments.

## Project Objectives

1. To provide a clear and comprehensive implementation of the Trivium cipher algorithm.
2. To demonstrate the practical application of stream ciphers in modern cryptography.
3. To offer interactive tools for understanding the internal workings of Trivium.
4. To analyze the security properties and performance characteristics of Trivium.
5. To showcase the application of Trivium in a real-world scenario (banking transaction).

## Features

1. **Complete Trivium Implementation**: A fully functional TypeScript implementation of the Trivium cipher, adhering to the original specifications.

2. **Interactive Key Generation**: Allows users to generate or input 80-bit keys and IVs, demonstrating the importance of proper key management in stream ciphers.

3. **Encryption and Decryption**: Step-by-step demonstration of how Trivium encrypts plaintext and decrypts ciphertext, visualizing the process of keystream generation and application.

4. **Visual State Representation**: An animated visualization of Trivium's internal 288-bit state, showing how the three shift registers interact during keystream generation.

5. **Comprehensive Banking Demo**: A detailed simulation of how Trivium can be used to secure financial transactions, providing context for real-world applications of stream ciphers.

6. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates and visualizes Trivium's efficiency with different input sizes, demonstrating its suitability for various applications.

7. **Security Analysis**: Provides insights into Trivium's cryptographic strengths and discusses potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

8. **Mathematical Background**: Detailed explanations of the mathematical principles underlying Trivium, including linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) and boolean functions.

9. **Cryptanalysis Overview**: Summarizes various cryptanalytic techniques applied to Trivium, including algebraic attacks, cube attacks, and correlation attacks.
