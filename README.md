## üåü Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive implementation and interactive demonstration of the Trivium stream cipher. Trivium, designed by Christophe De Canni√®re and Bart Preneel, is a synchronous stream cipher that generates up to 2^64 bits of keystream from an 80-bit secret key and an 80-bit initialization vector (IV). It was a finalist in the eSTREAM project, which aimed to identify new stream ciphers suitable for widespread adoption.

The Trivium cipher is notable for its simplicity, efficiency, and suitability for hardware implementation, making it an excellent subject for academic study and practical application in resource-constrained environments.
